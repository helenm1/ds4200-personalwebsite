    <h4>About Solidcore</h4>
    <p>
      Solidcore is a high-intensity, low-impact workout that focuses on slow and
      controlled movements to build strength and endurance. It follows the
      Lagree method, a form of Pilates performed on a reformer-like machine
      called the "Sweatlana." Unlike traditional Pilates, Solidcore emphasizes
      time under tension, meaning every movement is slow and controlled to keep
      muscles engaged for longer. This results in a challenging, full-body
      workout that improves muscle tone, endurance, and core stability. I
      started attending Solidcore classes in January 2025 at the Fenway studio
      in Boston, and it quickly became one of my favorite ways to stay active. I
      was drawn to it because of its unique approach to strength trainingâ€”rather
      than relying on heavy weights, it focuses on resistance and small,
      controlled movements. I used to engage in really high-impact weightlifting
      but that took a bit too much of a toll on my joints and body overall. Each
      session is structured to provide a balanced workout, targeting the core,
      upper body, lower body, and obliques. One of the things I love most about
      Solidcore is the motivating environment. The instructors are very
      supportive over the mic, pushing everyone to challenge themselves while
      maintaining proper form. The dim lighting and energetic music create an
      immersive experience, helping me stay focused.
